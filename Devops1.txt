DEVOPS:  (Development(Developers) + Operations(System admins, Testers, Middleware Engineers, DB Admins, Build and Release Engineers, etc)
-----------------
Devops is a set of automation tools which are used to speed up the process of delivering  a software application to the client.
 It is a practice speed up the processes between the developers and operations team.

SDLC : (Software Development Life Cycle)
 
SDLC MODELS:
 
>WATERFALL MODEL
>INCREMENTAL MODEL
>ITERATIVE MODEL
>AGILE SCRUM MODEL

>>AGILE SCRUM MODEL:  Working on Software Application by functionality(modules)wise completion. 
 Example: 
 Internet Banking application having functionalities like 
LOANS, DEBIT CARDS, CREDIT CARDS and ONLINE MONEY TRANSFER.

In Agile model first work on Loan functionality after completion developing  and testing(/UAT) of Loan functionality will deliver Loan 
functionality module to client to use it. Then client use the Loan functionality in his application. Here client get ROI(Return On Investment)
 within short time and no need to wait for all remaining functionalities on this time. Remain functionalities will complete one after onc and
 delivering to client accordingly.

>>Sprint: Time taken to complete developing, testing and delivering each functionality to client is called Sprint.

Version Controlling:
=================
All the team members upload their code into a remote server
which is called as code repository or a Version Controlling
System. This VCS accepts the code uploads  from multiple team members
and it integrates the code into a single project. Next time
when the team members download the code they will be able to
acces not onlt their code but also the code created by the entire team.

VCS's Preserve older and latest versions of the code so that the 
team members can toggle between what ever version they want.

VCS's keep a track of who is making what kind of changes at what time.


VCS's are classified into 2 types
======================================
1 Centralised Version Controlling
2 Distributed Version Controlling

Centralised Version Controlling
=================================
Here we have a remote server where version controlling is done
All the team members simply upload their code(checkin) into this
remote server

Eg: SVN (Sub Version)

Distributed Version controlling
==================================
Here we have a local repository on every team members machine where
the code is commited into and in the local repository version
controlling happens at the level of the individual team member.
Later this can be checked into a remote server where version
controlling happens at the level of entire team.

Eg: GIT

GIT is a both local repository and remote repository.
There is Remote Repositories like GITHUB are BITBUCKET, GITLAB, Beanstalk,SourceForge, GitKraken, AWS CodeCommit
and Cloud Source Repositories by Google. ...   

Bare repository: It is an important advanage of GIT
================
Version controlling happens in muliple levels(individual repos, sub module repos, entire appl repo)

Installing git on Windows
=========================
1 Open https://git-scm.com/downloads
2 Download git  for windows--->Install it
3 Once git is installed we get an application called 
  git bash.This is the command prompt of git where we can
  execute the git commands

Installing Git on Ubuntu
===========================
1 Open terminal in ubuntu
2 update the apt repository
  sudo apt-get update
3 Install git
  sudo apt-get install -y git

Installing RHEL,Centos,Fedora
================================
1 Open terminal in the linux server 
2 update the yum repository 
  yum -y update
3 Install git 
  yum install -y git

Setting up username and email globally for all users on a specific machine
=============================================================================
git config --global user.name "Ramesh"
git config --global user.email "rameshvsr999@gmail.com"

To see the list of Configurations on git
==========================================
git config --global --list
